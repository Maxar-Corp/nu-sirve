# SIRVE

SIRVE is a tool used for visual and scientific analysis of data from EO/IR sensors. It is currently hyper-specific to one data format and customer and likely to be ungeneralizable without a significant amount of work.

Note that SIRVE is fully goverment-owned software.

## Installing/Building SIRVE for Execution and Release

See the [full installation requirements README](docs/INSTALLATION.md) or the 
[CMake Installation Instructions](docs/INSTALLATION_CMake.md)for detailed

See the [debug instructions README](docs/DEBUG.md) for detailed debugging information. 
Note that you don't need to do anything special to build SIRVE in Debug mode
if you're using the CMake build system.
