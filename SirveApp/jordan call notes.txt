osm reader metadata model is "funky"

see class FrameData

lives in datastructures.h

this file is a 'catch all'

all the working metadata structs are in there

see osmreader.h

used when osm is loaded

struct frame is returned by load process

frame struct instance holds entire metadata of the movie

it's n frames long

 FrameHeader frame_header;
 MessageHeader msg_header;
 
 ^^^ don't care about these
 
HOWEVER, a frame has FrameData, which we DO care about.
 

osm reader's az-el calc was extracted by J.

that's why the osm reader, which wraps az-el, is basically a one-liner.

roiBLX, roiBLY, roiURX, roiURY ---> not the square centroid box, the OSM "Rectangle of Interest"

 no one uses this rectangle.

 i_fov_x --> instantaneous f.o.v.
 
 std::vector<double> az_el_boresight = calculation_azimuth_elevation(0, 0, data);
 
  --- >>> shows boresight has 0,0 as origin
  
  the az-el calculation is derived from the centroid x,y and metadata in the frame struct.
  
  In long-term, we make the manual tracks polygons.
